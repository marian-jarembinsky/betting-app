# Google Sheets API Integration Setup

This guide will help you configure your application to connect to your "Champions League 24/25 Results" Google Spreadsheet.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Google API Key and Spreadsheet ID

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
   - Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one

2. **Enable Google Sheets API:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

3. **Create API Key:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
   - Copy the generated API key

4. **Get your Spreadsheet ID:**
   - Open your "Champions League 24/25 Results" spreadsheet
   - Copy the ID from URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE/edit`

5. **Make spreadsheet public (for read access):**
   - In your spreadsheet, click "Share"
   - Click "Change to anyone with the link"
   - Set to "Viewer" permissions

### Step 2: Configure Your Application

Open `src/app/services/sheets.service.ts` and replace these values:

```typescript
private readonly GOOGLE_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
private readonly SPREADSHEET_ID = 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE';
```

### Step 3: Set Up Your Spreadsheet Format

Your Google Spreadsheet should have the following columns (A-G):

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Match Number | Round Number | Date | Location | Home Team | Away Team | Result |
| 1 | 1 | 16/09/2025 18:45:00 | Wembley Stadium | Real Madrid | Liverpool | 2-1 |
| 2 | 1 | 18/09/2025 20:00:00 | Allianz Arena | Bayern Munich | PSG |  |

**Column Details:**
- **A (Match Number)**: Unique match identifier (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **B (Round Number)**: Tournament round number (1 for Group Stage, 2 for Round of 16, etc.)
- **C (Date)**: Match date and time in DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format (e.g., "16/09/2025 18:45:00")
- **D (Location)**: Stadium/venue name
- **E (Home Team)**: Team playing at home
- **F (Away Team)**: Visiting team
- **G (Result)**: Match result in "X-Y" format (e.g., "2-1") or empty if not played yet

**Important Date Format Notes:**
- The application automatically converts DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format to ISO format internally
- Supports both date-only (DD/MM/YYYY) and datetime (DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS) formats
- Time component is preserved for match scheduling
